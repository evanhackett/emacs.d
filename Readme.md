# My Emacs Config

This is a WIP emacs config inspired by spacemacs. 

I really liked the ergonomics of spacemacs but I had a hard time tweaking it because I didn't know how anything worked. I decided to learn emacs from scratch and build up my own config to mimic some of the functionality I liked about spacemacs. I'm pretty happy with it so far, and I'd recommend others to try something similar if they feel that emacs starter kits are too overwhelming.
